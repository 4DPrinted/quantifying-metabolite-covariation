# Overlooked Covariates in Metabolite Abundances


## **Abstract:**


Dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of cancer progression yet exactly how cancer cells vary their
metabolic program during tumorigenesis remains unknown. Moreover, metabolism is highly
dynamic, which makes it challenging to study experimentally. Previous computational approaches
have utilized gene expression to infer metabolic profiles but failed to consider effects of external
covariates. In this study, we sought to systematically quantify the relationship between gene
expression, metabolome, and covariates. We developed and applied a novel computational
framework that combines unimodal covariate analysis with multimodal distance correlation to
integrate and analyze data from the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles and the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia. Four confounding covariates were identified in cancer cell line data, and these make
substantial contributions to the perceived information overlap between transcriptome and
metabolome which masks the “true” relationship between metabolite levels and metabolic gene
expression. Unimodal analyses associated 20.2% of metabolic variance with tissue of origin and
4.7% with extracellular environment, while 8.2% of variance associated with growth rate. In real
tumor data, tumor purity (proportion of cancer cells to immune cells) serves as the major covariate,
similar to cell line data where immunological cell lines have distinct metabolic profiles. This
underscores precautions that must be taken into consideration when comparing metabolic cell line
data to those from real tumors. Results of this study provide a standardized procedure for quantifying
the complex relationship between transcriptome and metabolome. Furthermore, these methods have
the potential to significantly advance our understanding of metabolic drug resistance and immune
response.
